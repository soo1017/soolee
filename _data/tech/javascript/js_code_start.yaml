              In this section, we will see what will happen when a Javascript code starts running. When a JS code (even with empty JS code) starts running, the Javascript engine automatically creats and runs a basic (global) execution context, which is a wrapper where the code is running. Generally, more execution contexts will be created and run during when the code is running. In the above, the 'global' is mentioned, which means that it is accessible from everywhere and everything in the code. Another meaning of 'global' in JS is 'not inside a function'. The global execution context has two things, global object and the special variable 'this' as default. The picture below depicts the flow of when a JS code starts running.

              For 'this' variable, In Chrome or other internet browsers, it ponits to the global object 'window' where the 'object' means a collection of name and its value in JS. In global level, 'this' and the global object 'window' are equal. But the variable 'this' points to another thing in different case. For example, it will point to other in NodeJS in the server. Please note that each tap of any browser will create its own global execution context

              When you write a code like below,<br>
              <br>
              var a = "Hello"<br>
              <br>
              function b() {<br>
                console.log('Hi') <br>
              }<br>
              <br>
              The variable 'a' and function 'b' would be a global object and they are attached to the global object 'window'. You can see it from the picture below where the circled parts show that the variable 'a' and the function 'b' are attached to the 'window' object when it is unfolded.

              As mentioned early, more execution contexts are created and come. When there is a function in the code, a execution context will be created for the function. Unlike gloabl execution context, this execution context will have a link 'outer environment' to reach out outside the function. The picture below shows the execution context created for the fucntion.
