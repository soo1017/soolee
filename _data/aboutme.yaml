        After more than a decade of my work in the industry of silicon testing, I wanted to start up a company with my colleagues to bring up one idea of mobile application to fruition in the field of entertainment. As this product would be my first software product, I wanted it made as perfect as possible in all aspects, not with any frustration and flaw. So I decided to develop it myself by searching and digging up in the area of mobile application development with a hope of every development under my control even though I had never worked on developing any mobile application before.<br>
        <br>
        It was my starting point to meet all mobile development tools, frameworks, and programming languages. I picked 'Cordova' as the tool that would, I thought, speed up the development for both Android and iOS instead of learning and employing their own tools and programming languages. It naturally led me into being able to explore front-end anf back-end of mobile and web applications at the same time in order to resolve technical issues and extend my understanding on them. Without full undestanding on any point in the development, I believed it was meaningless and vain for me and the development as well.<br>
        <br>
        It was fun to explore the field of full stack. I decided to pursue more as the second chapter of my career. In this space, I am able to work on freely and happily. I believe that this field is one where I am able to flourish, able to provide the best of my abilities for the users.<br>
