              AJAX can be used for interactive communication with a database.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>***** AJAX Database Example *****</strong><br>
              <br>
              The following example will demonstrate how a web page can fetch information from a database with AJAX:

              The showCustomer() function does the following:<br>
              <br>
              * Check if a customer is selected<br>
              * Create an XMLHttpRequest object<br>
              * Create the function to be executed when the server response is ready<br>
              * Send the request off to a file on the server<br>
              * Notice that a parameter (q) is added to the URL (with the content of the dropdown list)<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The page on the server called by the JavaScript above is a PHP file called "getcustomer.php".<br>
              The source code in "getcustomer.php" runs a query against a database, and returns the result in an HTML table:
