    A web application that supports online-order of food truck. An owner of the web application can update menu and their quantity only with admin authority anytime they want. All menu and their quantity are automatically controlled based on an owner's input and online order. If any menu runs out, the application does not take any online order more. Customers can see any updated data and process their payment using credit card. It is pretty much similar with any web application out there that handles online order. It is implemented by <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>.
