              The previous RCA scheduler makes a weekly schedule using Excel's embedded functions. It requires a lot of manual work to complete a schedule by clikcing cells and selecting one of available option routes. It generally takes an hour to make a weekly schedule and then the schedule is posted in a paper sheet for RCAs to refer to.<br>
              <br>
              This new tool makes the schedule making process very fast (about 10 mins) and effective. It also tries to relieve trouble for RCA by assigning a familar route to RCA at busy days. After a weekly schedule is made, it will be texted into each RCA. It is very convenient.<br>
